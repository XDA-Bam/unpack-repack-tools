So here is the "HOWTO" to explain what you have to do for unpack/repack normalboot.img.

You need Linux to do this (also a visrtualized distro).

1- download and unzip the attached file;
2- place the normalboot.img file into the tools folder;
3- go in the root folder and do:
Code:

./unpack-all.sh

4- now you have succesfull unpacked your file. You can find the zImage file in the "kernel" folder and the ramdisk files in the "ramdisk" folder.

Basically now you can do all that you want. If you have a custom kernel overwrite the zImage file with your. If you want edit the ramdisk go in the folder called "ramdisk" and mod what you want.

When you finished do:

Code:

./create_boot.img.sh

Now you will find the .tar file ready to be flashed on your phone with odin.

If you are asking yourself "where can i find normalboot.img file?" the answers are:

1- into the PDA.tar of your Firmware;
2- dump it from the phone with:
Code:

dd if=/dev/block/bml7 of=/sdcard/normalboot.img
